## 📝 Problem Statement

Blinkit (formerly Grofers) generates large volumes of sales data every day from various products, categories, and customer segments. However, this raw data is difficult to interpret without proper analysis and visualization. The company needs a centralized, interactive dashboard that can provide meaningful insights into:
- Overall sales performance
- Category-wise and product-wise revenue
- Customer purchasing trends
Time-based sales patterns
Key factors affecting sales

The current challenge is to transform scattered, unstructured sales data into a clear, visually engaging dashboard that supports quick decision-making for marketing, inventory management, and business strategy
